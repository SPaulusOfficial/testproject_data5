**\[00:00\] Alex:** Hi Sarah, hi David. Thanks for making the time today. I hope you're both doing well.

**\[00:15\] Sarah:** Hi Alex. Yes, all good here. Eager to dive into this. Our current method of tracking feedback in spreadsheets is becoming a real bottleneck after a project closes.

**\[00:28\] David:** Hey Alex. Same here. I've read your initial notes. Ready to talk data models.

**\[00:39\] Alex:** Perfect. So, the goal for this call is to finalize the high-level design for a new customer feedback framework directly within Salesforce. This should give you a 360-degree view of project success and customer satisfaction, which, as Sarah mentioned, will help streamline your post-sale process and identify happy customers for future opportunities.

**\[01:05\] Sarah:** Exactly. I want my account managers to be able to look at a past opportunity and immediately know if it was a success and who our champions were.

**\[01:20\] Alex:** Great. Let's start with the first piece of that puzzle. We need a way to capture feedback on the project or engagement that resulted from a won opportunity. I'm proposing a new custom object called Project\_Feedback\_\_c.

**\[01:45\] David:** Okay, Project\_Feedback\_\_c. How would this relate to the Opportunity?

**\[01:55\] Alex:** It would have a Lookup relationship to the Opportunity object. This way, you can create one or more feedback records for any given opportunity. We use a Lookup instead of a Master-Detail so that a feedback record can exist independently if needed, though the primary use case is to link it. On the Opportunity page layout, we'd add a related list so you can see all associated feedback at a glance.

**\[02:30\] Sarah:** That makes sense. What kind of information would we store on this Project\_Feedback\_\_c record?

**\[02:42\] Alex:** We'd start with key fields that summarize the project's success. I'm thinking of things like:

* Overall\_Satisfaction\_Score\_\_c (a numeric field, say 1-10)  
* Project\_Completion\_Date\_\_c (a Date field)  
* Feedback\_Summary\_\_c (a rich text field for the account manager's overview)  
* Strengths\_\_c and Areas\_for\_Improvement\_\_c (two separate text area fields to capture specifics).

**\[03:25\] Sarah:** I like that. It gives us quantifiable data with the score and qualitative context with the summary fields. That would be a huge improvement.

**\[03:40\] David:** The data model is straightforward. A lookup to Opportunity on Project\_Feedback\_\_c works for me. What's the next requirement?

**\[04:00\] Alex:** The next step is to capture feedback from the actual *people* involved in the projectâ€”the customer contacts. A project might be a success overall, but feedback can vary from the project manager to the end-user. This is where we need a more granular approach.

**\[04:25\] Alex:** For this, I propose a second custom object, let's call it Customer\_Feedback\_\_c. This object's purpose is to hold the specific sentiment of an individual. It would have a Lookup relationship to the Contact object, so we know exactly who gave the feedback.

**\[04:50\] Sarah:** So this is where we'd track things like an NPS score?

**\[04:58\] Alex:** Precisely. Key fields on Customer\_Feedback\_\_c would be:

* NPS\_Score\_\_c (a Number field for their Net Promoter Score)  
* Testimonial\_Quote\_\_c (a text field to capture a positive quote we could use)  
* Willing\_to\_be\_Reference\_\_c (a Checkbox field, which would be gold for your sales team).

**\[05:35\] David:** Okay, I'm following. We have Project\_Feedback\_\_c linked to the Opportunity, and Customer\_Feedback\_\_c linked to the Contact. But how do you link a specific person's feedback to a specific project's feedback? A contact could be involved in multiple projects over the years.

**\[06:00\] Alex:** Excellent question, David. That's the final piece of the model. We need a way to connect them, and for that, we'll use a junction object. We'll call it Customer\_Review\_\_c.

**\[06:20\] David:** Ah, a many-to-many relationship. So Customer\_Review\_\_c will have two Master-Detail relationships?

**\[06:33\] Alex:** Exactly. One Master-Detail relationship to Project\_Feedback\_\_c and a second one to Customer\_Feedback\_\_c. This junction object effectively says, "This specific person's feedback is related to this specific project." This structure ensures data integrity and allows for robust reporting.

**\[07:10\] Sarah:** Let me see if I understand this from a practical standpoint. We close a deal, which is an Opportunity. After the project is done, we create one Project\_Feedback\_\_c record for it. Then, we might talk to three key contacts at the client company, so we'd create three separate Customer\_Feedback\_\_c records, one for each person. And this Customer\_Review\_\_c object links those three people to that one project?

**\[07:45\] Alex:** You've got it perfectly. And the beauty of this is the reporting it unlocks. You could run a report on all Contacts with an NPS score of 9 or higher who have checked the "Willing to be Reference" box. Or you could view an Opportunity and see not just the overall project feedback, but also drill down into the specific reviews from every stakeholder involved.

**\[08:30\] David:** From a technical side, this is clean. It's scalable and avoids stuffing everything into one oversized object. I can build this data model out.

**\[08:45\] Sarah:** This is fantastic. This directly addresses our need to more easily identify champions and leverage positive project outcomes for future sales and marketing efforts. It connects the dots right from the Opportunity.

**\[09:15\] Alex:** Great. It sounds like we have a solid plan for the data model. My next step will be to build these three custom objects in your sandbox environment and configure the basic fields we've discussed. I'll then create a couple of sample records so you can see how they all connect.

**\[09:40\] David:** Sounds good. Let me know when it's ready and I can do a technical review.

**\[09:48\] Sarah:** Perfect. When do you think we could see that demo?

**\[09:55\] Alex:** I'll have the prototype ready by the end of this week. I'll send out a follow-up invite for early next week to walk you both through it.

**\[10:05\] Sarah:** Excellent. Thanks, Alex. This was very productive.

**\[10:10\] David:** Agreed. Thanks, Alex.

**\[10:12\] Alex:** My pleasure. Talk to you both next week. Have a great day.
